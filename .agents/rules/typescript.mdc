# TypeScript Type Conventions

## Common

Do not use “any”, “function”, “object” etc. as type definition.

## E2E Type Safety

Zod schemas → inferred types → mappers → component API types.

- Validate query data with Zod
- Infer types from schemas (`z.infer<typeof schema>`)
- Pass inferred types through app
- Mappers transform Zod-typed data to component API format

## Type vs Interface

Simple types → `type`. 
Complex/composed → `interface` with `extends`.
